**The essence of the project:**

In this project we plan to implement the following logic:

1. Choose a list of companies

2. Every week we will receive historical data on asset prices in a weekly timeframe, and we will calculate volatility and profitability (using the Exponential Smoothing regression)

3. Next, we will compile a Tobin portfolio (*with given rate of return*), taking weekly returns on US long term bonds as a risk free asset

4. Once a week we will calculate the portfolio results and compose the portfolio anew

5. At the end - we will summarize (spoiler - +4% over 3 weeks)


*Skills*:

Python, Time-series forecasting, Portfolio optimization, Statistics, Pandas, Numpy
